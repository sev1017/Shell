     -s      Display the number of blocks used in the file system by each
             file.  Block sizes and directory totals are handled as described
             in The Long Format subsection below, except (if the long format
             is not also requested) the directory totals are not output when
             the output is in a single column, even if multi-column output is
             requested.  (-l) format, display complete time information for
             the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.
             The -D option gives even more control over the output format.
             This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -t      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).
             If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their
             names in ascending lexicographical order.  The -r option reverses
             both of these sort orders.

             Note that these sort orders are contradictory: the time sequence
             is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in ascending
             order.  This behavior is mandated by IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).
             This feature can cause problems listing files stored with
             sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital
             cameras, where it is possible to have more than one image with
             the same timestamp.  In such a case, the photos cannot be listed
             in the sequence in which they were taken.  To ensure the same
             sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the
             environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -y option.  This
             causes ls to reverse the lexicographical sort order when sorting
             files with the same modification timestamp.

     -u      Use time of last access, instead of time of last modification of
             the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).

     -v      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.

     -w      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.  This option is not
             defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

     -x      The same as -C, except that the multi-column output is produced
             with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.

     -y      When the -t option is set, sort the alphabetical output in the
             same order as the time output.  This has the same effect as
             setting LS_SAMESORT.  See the description of the -t option for
             more details.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
             (“POSIX.1”).

     -%      Distinguish dataless files and directories with a '%' character
             in long

     -1      (The numeric digit “one”.) Force output to be one entry per line.
             This is the default when output is not to a terminal.  (-l)
             output, and don't materialize dataless directories when listing
             them.

     -,      (Comma) When the -l option is set, print file sizes grouped and
             separated by thousands using the non-monetary separator returned
             by localeconv(3), typically a comma or period.  If no locale is
             set, or the locale does not have a non-monetary separator, this
             option has no effect.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std
             1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).
